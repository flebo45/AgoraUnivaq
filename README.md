## Requirements

Installation on local server requirements:

1. Install xampp ([XAMPP Download](https://www.apachefriends.org/it/download.html)) on your machine (inlcluding php)
1. Install composer ([Composer Downlaod](https://getcomposer.org/download/)) on your machine

## Installation Guide

1. Download the git repository;
1. Move the repositoy under `htdocs/` folder in Xampp and rename the folder `Agora`

1. Now you need to install [Doctrine ORM](https://www.doctrine-project.org/), to do that you need to open terminal in the folder of your application (that will be in `xampp/htdocs`) and run `composer install`

1. Once you installed Doctrine Orm, you need to modify some source code in `vendor/` folder; in `/vendor/doctrine/orm/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Configuration.php` at line 150 (approximately) you need to change the `$simpleAnnotationReader` to `false` in the parameter of that function, and delete all references to the SimpleAnnotation Reader in the function

1. On Xampp (you can use phpmyadmin) create a new empty database

1. In the application you can find a folder called `config`, in this folder locate a file called `config.php` and change the parameters according to your xampp and mysql settings

1. Now it's all setup, you only need to create the database tables running `vendor/bin/doctrine orm:schema-tool:create` in the root folder of the application (`xampp/htdocs/Agora`)

1. Open your browser and digit in the URL `localhost/Agora` and enjoy the application
